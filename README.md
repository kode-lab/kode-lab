- 👋 Hi, I’m Kode Blue! @kode-lab is my public GitHub where you can find most of my code.
- 👀 I’m interested in Networks and Cybersecurity, and I love teaching people about computers. Your compter is a tool, you shouldn't be afraid of it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Python, and I have some experience with C++, as well as a _tiny_ bit of VisualBasic. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email me: kkatfish@cs.colostate.edu (please include "ns: " in the subject line, so that it isn't caught by anti-spam filters.
